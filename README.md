# API-Sprint

This is a consolidation challenge that will help us consolidate our ability to solve a problem inspired from real-life situations using your new javascript muscles involving the following know-hows:

- **DOM** manipulation
- **AJAX**/**FETCH** request
- Using **Third-party libraries**
- **Problem-solving** : design a logical solution to implement the expected result
- Debugging using the console
- Understand the notion of **"separation of concerns"**
